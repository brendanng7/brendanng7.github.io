Repository for my portfolio website

brief description of the website. The website works on both mobile and on desktop. It is inspired by Pokemon FireRed, my favourite pokemon game by far as it brings back a lot of childhood memories. 

If it seems like the typewriter text has stopped, please click on the textbox and the website will display the next set of text.

## this is my first time learning git
please be patient with me...
